### 1. Project Breakdown  
**App Name:** LocaleQuest  
**Platform:** Web  
**Summary:** LocaleQuest is a web application designed to help users discover popular activities, restaurants, bars, and hotels in their vicinity. By leveraging real-time location data, advanced search filters, and seamless integrations with external booking platforms, the app provides a personalized and efficient way for users to explore and reserve the best local spots. The vision is to create a one-stop solution for users to effortlessly find and book experiences tailored to their preferences and location.  
**Primary Use Case:** A user opens the app, allows location access, and searches for nearby restaurants. They apply filters (e.g., cuisine type, price range) and view detailed information about each option. The user can then make a reservation directly through the app or be redirected to the booking platform.  
**Authentication Requirements:** Users can sign up or log in using email/password or third-party providers (Google, Apple) via Supabase Auth. Authentication is required for saving preferences, making reservations, and accessing booking history.

### 3. Core Features  
1. **Location-Based Discovery:**  
   - Use browser geolocation API to fetch the user's current location.  
   - Display nearby activities, restaurants, bars, and hotels on an interactive map.  

2. **Advanced Search Filters:**  
   - Filters for cuisine type, price range, ratings, distance, and availability.  
   - Real-time updates to search results as filters are applied.  

3. **Detailed Place Information:**  
   - Show photos, reviews, menus, and contact details for each place.  
   - Integrate with external APIs (e.g., Google Places, Yelp) for enriched data.  

4. **Reservation System:**  
   - Allow users to make reservations directly through the app using Supabase database.  
   - Redirect users to external booking platforms for unavailable options.  

5. **User Profiles:**  
   - Save preferences, booking history, and favorite places.  
   - Enable personalized recommendations based on past activity.  

6. **Real-Time Updates:**  
   - Use Supabase real-time features to notify users of reservation confirmations or changes.

### 4. User Flow  
1. **Landing Page:**  
   - User arrives at the homepage and is prompted to allow location access.  

2. **Search and Filter:**  
   - User enters a search query (e.g., "Italian restaurants") and applies filters.  

3. **Results Display:**  
   - Results are displayed as a list and on an interactive map.  

4. **Place Details:**  
   - User clicks on a place to view detailed information, photos, and reviews.  

5. **Reservation:**  
   - User selects a time and makes a reservation directly through the app or is redirected to an external booking site.  

6. **Confirmation:**  
   - User receives a confirmation message and can view booking details in their profile.

### 5. Design and UI/UX Guidelines  
- **Color Palette:** Use a modern, neutral palette with accents for calls-to-action (e.g., deep blue for buttons, soft gray for backgrounds).  
- **Typography:** Sans-serif fonts (e.g., Inter) for readability and a clean look.  
- **Layout:** Responsive grid layout with cards for place listings and a sidebar for filters.  
- **Interactive Elements:** Hover effects on cards, smooth transitions for filter updates, and a sticky "Reserve Now" button on place detail pages.  
- **Accessibility:** Ensure all components are keyboard-navigable and comply with WCAG standards.

### 6. Technical Implementation Approach  
1. **Frontend (React + Next.js):**  
   - Use Next.js for server-side rendering of place listings and dynamic routing for place detail pages.  
   - Implement a custom hook (`useLocation`) to fetch and manage user location data.  
   - Create reusable components (e.g., `PlaceCard`, `FilterPanel`) using ShadCN and Tailwind CSS.  

2. **Backend (Supabase):**  
   - Store user profiles, preferences, and booking history in Supabase tables.  
   - Use Supabase Auth for user authentication and session management.  
   - Leverage Supabase real-time features to push reservation updates to users.  

3. **Integrations:**  
   - Fetch place data from external APIs (e.g., Google Places) using Next.js API routes.  
   - Use Supabase Edge Functions for serverless logic (e.g., handling reservation requests).  

4. **Deployment (Vercel):**  
   - Deploy the app to Vercel with automatic CI/CD for seamless updates.  
   - Configure environment variables for API keys and Supabase credentials.
